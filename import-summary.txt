ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .idea/
* .idea/.name
* .idea/coloring.iml
* .idea/compiler.xml
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/encodings.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/scopes/
* .idea/scopes/scope_settings.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* LICENSE
* NOTICE
* raw/
* raw/.DS_Store
* raw/color.sh
* raw/colors.html
* releases/
* releases/.DS_Store
* releases/coloring-0.9.0.apk
* releases/coloring-0.9.1.apk
* releases/coloring-1.0.0-RC1.apk
* releases/coloring-1.0.0-RC2.apk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/androidsoft-credits-1.1.0.jar => app/libs/androidsoft-credits-1.1.0.jar
* libs/androidsoft-utils-1.0.0.jar => app/libs/androidsoft-utils-1.0.0.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
